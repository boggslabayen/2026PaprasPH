              Cleft Lip and Palate repair is a reconstructive procedure that
              aims to correct abnormalities or birth defects within the lip and
              face.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is a very common abnormality among infants, which can be
              caused by genetic or environmental factors during fetal
              development. It is characterized by the incomplete development of
              the roof of the mouth or upper lip.
              <br />
              <br />
              This procedure helps correct the physical appearance as well as
              restore air flow and breathing functions.

              Cleft Lip and Palate Repairs are highly individualized procedures,
              which require extensive support from various medical
              professionals.

              <br />
              Our expert team of PAPRAS doctors along with medical professionals
              will help evaluate and recommend the best form of treatment for
              patients. This usually involves a team of plastic surgeons,
              pediatricians, orthodontists, ENT specialists, speech therapists,
              and more.

              Depending on the severity of the cleft lip and palate, cleft lift
              repair may be done among infants anywhere between ages 2-6months,
              while cleft palate repairs may be done from 9-18 months.

              Child patients may be unable to eat or drink normally following
              the procedure. During this time, intravenous feeding may be
              recommended by your PAPRAS surgeon. It is very important that
              parents strictly adhere to the feeding guidelines provided by
              doctors following the surgery to avoid any possible risks or
              complications.

              Following health and safety guidelines, your plastic surgeon may
              advise you to provide thorough information on your medical
              history. In this time of COVID-19, rhinoplasty is considered a
              high-risk procedure and requires a negative PCR swab result prior
              to surgery.
